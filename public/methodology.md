## Sustainability Assessment Framework

### Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

The sustainability scoring system is based on Life Cycle Assessment principles, evaluating:

- **GHG Emissions**: Carbon footprint (kg CO2e/kg)
- **Water Usage**: Water consumption in production
- **Energy Consumption**: Energy required for manufacturing
- **Waste Generation**: Production waste and end-of-life considerations

### Scoring Methodology

The sustainability score (1-6 scale) is calculated using:

```
Score Ranges:
- 5-6: High sustainability (low environmental impact)
- 3-4: Medium sustainability (moderate environmental impact)
- 1-2: Low sustainability (high environmental impact)
```
